# Sampling_Assignment


In this python code, we have used sampling techniques on a credit card fraud detection dataset 
and then applied various ML models on the dataset to find out which Model,sampling technique combination
gives us the best accuracy.

Worked on it using 5 sampling Techniques 
1. Random Under Sampler 
2. Random Over Sampler 
3. SMOTE (Sampling3)
4. TOMEK links 
5. Near Miss
